# Jsmn JSONpath
A JSONPath (http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) implementation for jsmn (https://github.com/zserge/jsmn).  

## THIS IS STILL IN EARLY BETA

## Usage
For an example look in the tests directory. For the implementation to work jsmn must be compiled with parent links.
You can normally (if you use gcc or clang) achieve this by adding the `-DJSMN_PARENT_LINKS` option to the compile command.

## Compile options
You can control the behaviour of jsmn-jsonpath with a few compile options:  
1. `JJP_NO_STDARG` if defined disables the use of stdarg.h ( `va_list, va_start, ...` ) in all functions. Note that you will then
only be able to parse one jsonpath expression at a time, which can be slower ... .  
2. `JJP_LOG` if defined enables logging of all jjp errors to stderr (look at dbg.h for more info). Primarly useful for developing
and debugging jsmn-jsonpath.  
  
## TODO:  
1. add json array support ( [] operator )  
2. maybe add other operators( union, array slice, ... )  
3. optimize performance by searching for similar path only once in one function call  

## Bugs
I am sure there are many...
Please report them on github as new issues.
